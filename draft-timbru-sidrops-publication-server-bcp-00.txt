1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Introduction

   [RFC8181] describes the RPKI Publication Protocol that is used
   between RPKI Certificate Authorities (CAs) and their Publication
   Repository server.  The server is responsible for handling
   publication requests sent by the CAs, called Publishers in this
   context, and ensuring that their data is made available to RPKI
   Relying Parties (RPs) in in public rsync and RRDP [RFC8182]
   publication points.

   In this document we will describe best current practices based on the
   operational experience of several implementers and operators.

3.  Acknowledgements

   This document is the result of many informal discussions between
   implementers.  Proper acknowledgements will follow.
